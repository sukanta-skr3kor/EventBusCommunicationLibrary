# EventBusCommunicationLibrary
 
About this library:
This is a reusable component for EventBus architecture, developed in dot net core (V6.0) and dot net standard (V2.1) and targeted for the Dot Net developer’s community.
Some of the widely used messaging broker (RabbitMQ, MQTT, Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage Queue, Redis DB, Kafka) implementations are provided and developers can follow the example and documentation to implement additional brokers if required.
The technical documentation and example samples are provided for the developers to quick start with it with minimal time to be spent on using and learning this library.
All technical documentation can be found in the Doc folder and can be accessed by clicking the Index.html page. 
Why this library?
•	Out of the box support to ingest and consume data from popular event brokers like (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Mqtt etc.)
•	Easy to integrate and implement EventBus pattern in the microservice projects. Publish-subscribe based mechanism.
•	Developers can publish and handle the events through dedicated event handlers defined by them.
•	Resiliency built-in, i.e., all possible error conditions are handled using Polly Dot Net library.
•	Examples and demo projects given for easy integration and understanding.
